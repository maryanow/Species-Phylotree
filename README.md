Species-Phylotree
=================
Uses DNA sequences of species to build a phylogenetic tree. The comparison between similarities and differences between DNA sequences can infer the hierarchical structure of the given species' evolutionary relationships.  
  
FigTree [http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/] can be used on .tree files, generated from the program, to visualize evolutionary relationships.
